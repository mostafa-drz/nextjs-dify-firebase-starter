# AI Task Commands

This document defines common AI task commands and their expected workflows.

## "stage them in related groups"

**Command**: "stage them in related groups" or "stage changes in logical groups"

**Expected Workflow**:

1. **Analyze** all unstaged changes and group them logically by purpose/functionality
2. **Stage ONE group at a time** using `git add`
3. **Wait for user approval** before proceeding to next group
4. **Present each group** with clear description of what it contains
5. **Only stage next group** after user says "ok", "approved", "next", etc.

**Example Groups**:

- Bug fixes
- Feature additions
- Refactoring
- Configuration changes
- Documentation updates
- Test updates

**What NOT to do**:

- ❌ Stage all groups at once
- ❌ Assume user wants everything staged
- ❌ Skip waiting for approval between groups

**What TO do**:

- ✅ Stage one logical group
- ✅ Explain what's in the group
- ✅ Wait for user approval
- ✅ Only then proceed to next group

## "review them"

**Command**: "review them" or "review changes"

**Expected Workflow**:

1. Show git diff for staged changes
2. Explain what each change does
3. Highlight any potential issues
4. Wait for user decision (commit, unstage, modify)

## "commit them separately"

**Command**: "commit them separately"

**Expected Workflow**:

1. Create individual commits for each logical group
2. Use descriptive commit messages
3. One commit per group, not one big commit
4. Wait for approval before each commit

## General Principles

- **Always wait for user approval** before proceeding to next step
- **One task at a time** - don't batch multiple operations
- **Explain what you're doing** before doing it
- **Ask for clarification** if unsure about grouping or approach
