# ðŸš« Proactive Code Changes Policy

**CRITICAL**: Never make proactive code changes without explicit user confirmation.

- **Ask First**: Always ask for permission before adding code or making changes
- **Keep Codebase Lean**: Avoid unnecessary additions that bloat the codebase
- **Wait for Confirmation**: Only proceed with code changes after explicit user approval
