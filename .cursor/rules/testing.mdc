# ðŸ§ª Testing Rules

## Testing Framework: Vitest (NOT Jest)

- Use `import { vi } from 'vitest'` for mocks
- Use `vi.mock()`, `vi.fn()`, `vi.clearAllMocks()`
- Add `/** @vitest-environment jsdom */` for component tests

## Minimal Testing Approach

- **Essential tests only** - avoid exhaustive coverage for simple bugs
- **Focus on behavior** - test what the code should do, not implementation details
- **One test per bug** - don't over-test, focus on specific issues
