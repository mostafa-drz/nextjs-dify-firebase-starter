# Testing Principles

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

**Quality over Quantity**: Focus on tests that prevent real bugs and provide confidence in critical functionality.

## 📋 Testing Principles

### 1. **Self-Descriptive Tests**

- Test names should clearly describe what is being tested and the expected outcome
- Use descriptive test descriptions: `should deduct credits when user has sufficient balance`
- Avoid generic names like `test1` or `works correctly`
- Test structure should be readable without comments

### 2. **Essential Focus**

- Test business-critical logic first: credit system, authentication, payment flows
- Test edge cases that could break the application
- Test error handling and failure scenarios
- Skip testing trivial getters/setters unless they contain business logic

### 3. **Not Exhaustive**

- Don't test every possible combination
- Don't test implementation details
- Don't test third-party libraries (Firebase, Dify)
- Don't test simple data transformations unless they're business-critical

### 4. **Real-World Scenarios**

- Test user journeys, not individual functions in isolation
- Focus on integration points where things can break
- Test the "happy path" and the most common failure modes
- Prioritize tests that catch regressions

### 5. **Maintainable Tests**

- Tests should be easy to understand and modify
- Use clear test data and fixtures
- Avoid complex test setup that's hard to maintain
- Prefer simple, focused tests over complex, comprehensive ones

### 6. **Fast Feedback**

- Tests should run quickly (< 5 seconds for unit tests)
- Use mocks for external dependencies
- Avoid slow operations in tests (file I/O, network calls)
- Focus on fast feedback over comprehensive coverage

## 🚫 What We Don't Test

- **Third-party libraries**: Firebase SDK, Dify API, React components
- **Simple utilities**: Basic string manipulation, date formatting
- **Configuration**: Environment variables, constants
- **Styling**: CSS classes, visual appearance
- **Trivial functions**: Getters/setters without business logic

## ✅ What We Do Test

- **Business logic**: Credit calculations, user authentication flows
- **Error handling**: What happens when things go wrong
- **Integration points**: Where different parts of the system connect
- **User journeys**: Complete workflows from start to finish
- **Edge cases**: Boundary conditions, empty states, error states

## 📊 Coverage Philosophy

- **Target**: 80% coverage for critical business logic
- **Acceptable**: 60% overall coverage
- **Focus**: Quality of tests over quantity
- **Measure**: Number of bugs caught, not just line coverage

## 🎯 Test Categories Priority

1. **Critical Business Logic** (Must have)
   - Credit system operations
   - User authentication flows
   - Payment processing
   - Rate limiting

2. **Integration Points** (Should have)
   - API endpoints
   - Database operations
   - External service calls

3. **User Journeys** (Nice to have)
   - Complete workflows
   - Error recovery flows
   - Edge case handling

## 🔧 Test Organization

- **One test file per source file**
- **Group related tests with `describe` blocks**
- **Use clear, descriptive test names**
- **Keep tests focused and simple**
- **Use consistent naming conventions**

## 📝 Test Naming Convention

```typescript
// Good: Describes what and when
describe('Credit System', () => {
  it('should deduct credits when user has sufficient balance', () => {
    // test implementation
  });

  it('should reject transaction when user has insufficient credits', () => {
    // test implementation
  });
});

// Bad: Generic or unclear
describe('Credits', () => {
  it('works', () => {
    // test implementation
  });

  it('test1', () => {
    // test implementation
  });
});
```

## 🎯 Success Metrics

- **Bug Prevention**: Tests catch bugs before they reach production
- **Confidence**: Developers can refactor with confidence
- **Maintenance**: Tests are easy to understand and modify
- **Speed**: Tests run quickly and provide fast feedback
- **Relevance**: Tests focus on what matters most to users and business

_These principles ensure our tests provide maximum value with minimal effort, focusing on what truly matters for application reliability and developer confidence._
