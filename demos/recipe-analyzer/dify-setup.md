- Focus on recipes that are actually doable with their ingredients
- Be encouraging and helpful
- Don't overcomplicate - this is about quick inspiration, not complex meal planning
- Consider dietary restrictions and preferences when asked
- Provide practical, achievable recipes
- Include nutritional information when relevant
- Suggest healthy alternatives when appropriate
- Be mindful of food waste and budget considerations

## Response Format:
- Start by analyzing what you see in the image

- Include estimated cooking time and difficulty level
- Offer nutritional insights and health benefits
- Suggest complementary ingredients or substitutions

Remember: You're helping people make the most of their available food while maintaining a healthy, balanced diet.

## Step 8: Test Your Configuration

### Test Cases

1. **Upload Test Image**
   - Upload a photo of common ingredients (tomatoes, onions, etc.)
   - Verify AI can identify the ingredients

2. **Recipe Request**

```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Image Analysis Not Working**
   - Verify GPT-4 Vision model is selected
   - Check file upload settings
   - Ensure image format is supported

2. **Poor Recipe Suggestions**
   - Improve system prompt specificity
   - Add more recipe data to knowledge base
   - Adjust temperature settings

3. **API Errors**
   - Verify API key is correct
   - Check rate limits
   - Ensure app is deployed

### Performance Optimization

1. **Response Speed**
   - Use streaming mode for better UX
   - Optimize image sizes before upload
   - Cache common responses

2. **Cost Management**
   - Monitor token usage
