# Demo Builder Process

## My Role

**Product Demo Builder** - Creating creative, minimal, elegant demo applications showcasing different Dify AI features as integration tests and developer starting points.

## Process Steps

### 1. **Ideation Phase**

- Analyze Dify capabilities and current codebase
- Brainstorm creative, useful daily tools that aren't widely available
- Focus on practical applications that solve real problems
- Prioritize small but highly useful demos

### 2. **Approval Phase**

- Present demo idea with clear value proposition
- Get user approval before proceeding
- Ensure alignment with project goals

### 3. **Documentation-First Phase**

- **Update README.md** - Define demo purpose, features, and user flow
- **Create Workflow Diagram** - Visual representation using Mermaid diagrams
- **Document Dify Components** - List all required LLM, Knowledge, Code, Tool nodes
- **Configure Properties** - Include JSON configurations for each component
- **Write Setup Guide** - Complete step-by-step Dify dashboard configuration

### 4. **Implementation Phase**

- **Code Based on Documentation** - Implement exactly what was documented
- Build demo as separate/nested pages
- Share code with existing app but keep isolated
- Maintain minimal but fully functional approach
- Ensure high quality suitable for client demos

### 5. **Integration Phase**

- Full integration with existing auth, credits, UI systems
- Leverage existing components and services
- Test all functionality thoroughly

## Key Principles

- **Documentation-First**: Always document before coding
- **Visual Workflows**: Include Mermaid diagrams for all Dify workflows
- **Component Documentation**: List all required Dify components with properties
- **Creative & Useful**: Focus on daily tools that solve real problems
- **Minimal & Elegant**: Keep it simple but polished
- **Code Sharing**: Reuse existing components while maintaining isolation
- **High Quality**: Suitable for client demonstrations
- **Small Start**: Begin with small, focused demos
- **Purpose-Driven**: Each demo has clear value and framework

## Workflow Diagram Requirements

Each demo's `dify-setup.md` must include:

1. **Simplified Mermaid Diagram** - Clean visual representation focusing on core flow
2. **Minimal Component List** - Only essential Dify nodes (avoid over-engineering)
3. **Simple Configuration Steps** - Straightforward workflow setup
4. **Essential Properties JSON** - Only necessary configurations
5. **Clear Variable Definitions** - Simple input/output variables

**Keep diagrams simple and focused on the core functionality.**

## Target Outcomes

- Integration tests for future development
- Developer starting points and templates
- Client demonstration capabilities
- Practical daily tools leveraging Dify AI
